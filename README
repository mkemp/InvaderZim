This is a somewhat cleaned up version of my final
submission to the Google AI Planet Wars Challenge [1]
InvaderZim v20.

Matt Kemp [2]

* Project Structure

The source code is divided between the submitted code
in src/main/java and unit tests in src/test/java. Due
to the limitations of the java submissions the only
code that this project depends on is JUnit [3].
For similar reasons there is no package heirarchy,
all classes are in the default package.

Logically each class falls into one of three areas:
strategy (actual bot code), framework (game, fleets,
planets, universe) and utility (chain, filter,
functions, iterators, mapper, predicates, reduce).
The final submission (with copyright notices and
some comments) weighed in at just over 4500 LOC.
Interestingly enough the strategy portion made up
only 25%, the framework and utility portions weighed
in at 35% and 40% respectively.
